# Fowl Play

Fowl Play adds a variety of birds to Minecraft, with the aim of giving them realistic behaviours and sounds. Unlike the fluttering parrots of the base game, the avians of this mod can all take to the skies gracefully (except, of course, flightless birds). Some of them add ambience, others have useful features and all of them try to annoy you as much as they can, just like real birds!

## Disclaimer

_This mod is in beta, and some features are incomplete. As always, it's possible I may change some stuff that causes progress to be lost, or worlds to be corrupted. If you could help me find some bugs, that would be awesome!_

## Mobs

_This mod adds a custom chicken model in the style of its other birds. The model can be disabled in the config, although a restart is required for it to take effect._

**Added mobs:**

- Penguin (Emperor penguin)
- Gull (Herring gull, ring-billed gull)
- Robin (American robin)
- Pigeon (Rock pigeon)
- Cardinal
- Blue Jay
- Old world Sparrow (House sparrow)
- Chickadee (Black-capped chickadee)
- Raven
- Duck (Mallard duck)

**Planned additions (in order of priority):**

- Hawks (Red tailed hawk, osprey)
- Woodpeckers (Downy woodpecker, pileated woodpecker, yellow-bellied sapsucker)
- Geese (Domestic goose, Canada goose)
- Eagles (Bald eagle, golden eagle)
- Owls (Great horned owl, snowy owl)
- New world Vultures (Black vulture, turkey vulture)
- Falcons (Peregrine falcon, gyrfalcon)
- Crows
- Finches (American goldfinch, house finch)
- New world Blackbirds (Red-winged blackbird, common grackle)
