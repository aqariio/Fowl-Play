# Fowl Play

Fowl Play adds a variety of birds to Minecraft, with the aim of giving them realistic behaviours and sounds. Unlike the fluttering parrots of the base game, the avians of this mod can all take to the skies gracefully (except flightless birds, of course). Some of them add ambience, others have useful features and all of them try to annoy you as much as they can, just like real birds!

## Important Information

This mod currently **does not have a dedicated Forge version**. If you would like to play it on Forge / NeoForge, **I have provided a Sinytra Connector compatible version**. Do keep in mind that **_Fowl Play_** being loaded with Connector can cause crashes with some mods, so this is not a guaranteed solution.

<details>
<summary>I have problems with Sinytra Connector!</summary>

To use Sinytra connector, you must **download the version labelled under Forge / NeoForge**, or download older versions from my [GitHub](https://github.com/aqariio/Fowl-Play/releases). This is because the **normal release will crash** when loaded using Sinytra.

**If you are using the 1.21 version of the mod with Sinytra connector**, mobs will no longer be able to move in water. **To fix this, you will need https://github.com/unilock/sinytra1343**. ([Link to releases page](https://github.com/unilock/sinytra1343/releases))

<details>
<summary>Here is the explanation for why you need to download a special release for Sinytra connector:</summary>

The mixin redirect _fowlplay\$modifySlipperiness_ and inject _fowlplay\$increaseAirSpeed_ in LivingEntityMixin cause a crash when loaded with Sinytra connector. This is because they modify code that does not exist when loaded with Forge. Both getAirSpeed() and getSlipperiness() are implemented differently in Forge compared to Fabric, which is what causes this crash. The special jars in the GitHub releases simply remove these two mixins. As for the fix for the 1.21 version, the solution was given in [this](https://github.com/aqariio/Fowl-Play/issues/15) thread.
