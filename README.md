# Fowl Play

Fowl Play adds more birds to Minecraft, with realistic behaviours, sounds, and flying mechanics. Unlike fluttering parrots and chickens, Fowl Play's birds can all take to the skies gracefully (_except flightless birds_). Some of them add ambience, others have useful features and all of them try to annoy you as much as they can!

## Important Information

To play this mod on Forge / NeoForge, there is a **Sinytra Connector version**. Keep in mind that Fowl Play being loaded with Connector **can cause crashes** with some mods; it is not 100% stable.

**If you're using the 1.21 Sinytra connector version**, mobs won't be able to move in water. To fix this, you will need to add [sinytra1343](https://github.com/unilock/sinytra1343/releases) as well.
