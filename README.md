# Fowl Play

Fowl Play adds a variety of birds to Minecraft, with the aim of giving them realistic behaviours and sounds. Unlike the fluttering parrots of the base game, the avians of this mod can all take to the skies gracefully (except flightless birds, of course). Some of them add ambience, others have useful features and all of them try to annoy you as much as they can, just like real birds!

## Important Information

This mod currently **does not have a dedicated Forge version**. If you would like to play it on Forge / NeoForge, **I have provided a Sinytra Connector compatible version**. Do keep in mind that **_Fowl Play_** being loaded with Connector can cause crashes with some mods, so this is not a guaranteed solution.

**If you're using the 1.21 Sinytra connector version**, entities won't be able to move in water. To fix this, you will need to add [sinytra1343](https://github.com/unilock/sinytra1343/releases) as well.
